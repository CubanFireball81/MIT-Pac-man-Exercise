# Pacman Factory

Simple game to create and randomly move pacman objects in the browser.

## Description

In this project I learned about array's and their methods, accessing the DOM and manipulating it using JavaScript, and I learned how to keep track of objects and their properties in order to use that information to take action in other parts of my code. 

This project might seem simple but that is false. Gaining access to the browser's width and height properties is fairly easy but can be challenging if the browser window changes. Placing an item on the screen, in the browser, and have it move randomly while also staying within the constraints of the browsers window is also a challenge. 

Overall, this project was a great challenge and I learned many new concepts and one way of doing things, out of many different ways they could have been done.
